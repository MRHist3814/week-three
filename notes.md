READINGS

* 'Messiness' of digital history.

* Removal of stationers from maps. What impact did this have?

* 'Soft' history. What are the ramifications of leaving things out?

  * Seems analogous to a 'paper trail,' much like footnotes in conventional history.

REGEX

* Followed initial instructions, but texas.txt was blank. Working in default Windows Command Prompt fixed this.

* Is there an easy way to delete 55,000 lines of text? 

OPEN REFINE

* Something went wrong. I clicked 'create project' and it put all three columns of data from .csv file into a single column.

* Eventually found the problem. The layout was defaulted to 'tabs' not 'commas.' Changing that fixed it. (Screenshot 1).

* Ended up with slightly different numbers of results due to uncertainties of what to cluster, but hopefully this isn't an issue.

NETWORKS

* Had issues with my own file on databasic, but used the file on the syllabus and the initial steps worked.

* Got the internal server error like many other students, swapped to Palladio.

* Everything seems to have worked as intended. Not sure I understand the functionality of dragging around the nodes in the network.

GEPHI

* Kept encountering the error 'cannot find Java 1.8' when trying to launch Gephi. Installed latest version of Java and still no dice.

* Eventually found this tutorial that got it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWQWjx6Ot1E

* Took a few times running through the steps to understand what I was doing, but I eventually got the hang of it.
